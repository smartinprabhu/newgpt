# Backend Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the Zentere API backend to fetch real Business Units (BUs) and Lines of Business (LOBs) instead of using mock data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created API Client (`src/lib/api-client.ts`)
- **ZentereAPIClient class** with methods to:
  - `authenticate()` - Authenticate with Zentere API using OAuth2
  - `searchRead()` - Generic method to query any model
  - `getBusinessUnits()` - Fetch unique BUs from `data_feeds` model
  - `getLinesOfBusiness()` - Fetch unique LOBs from `data_feeds` model
  - `getBusinessUnitsWithLOBs()` - Fetch complete BU structure with nested LOBs

- **Singleton pattern** via `getAPIClient()` function for reusability

### 2. Updated App Provider (`app-provider.tsx`)
- **Removed mock data dependency** - Changed from `mockBusinessUnits` to empty array initially
- **Added useEffect hook** to load BUs/LOBs on mount when authenticated
- **Added new action types**:
  - `SET_BUSINESS_UNITS` - Replace all business units with backend data
  - `SET_LOADING` - Control loading state during API calls

- **Updated existing actions** to match the full BusinessUnit type structure:
  - `ADD_BU` - Now includes all required fields (code, startDate, displayName, etc.)
  - `ADD_LOB` - Now includes all required fields (code, businessUnitId, startDate, etc.)
  - `UPLOAD_DATA` - Fixed to use `lobs` instead of `linesOfBusiness`
  - `TOGGLE_VISUALIZATION` - Fixed to properly toggle visualization state

### 3. Data Flow
```
1. User logs in → isAuthenticated = true
2. useEffect triggers → loadBusinessUnits()
3. API Client authenticates with stored credentials
4. Fetches data_feeds records from backend
5. Extracts unique BUs and LOBs
6. Dispatches SET_BUSINESS_UNITS with structured data
7. UI updates with real backend data
```

### 4. Backend Data Structure
From `backend/testing.ipynb`, the `data_feeds` model contains:
- `business_unit_id`: `[id, "name"]` or `false`
- `lob_id`: `[id, "name"]` or `false`

The API client extracts these tuples and creates proper TypeScript objects.

### 5. Authentication
- Uses credentials from localStorage:
  - `zentere_username` (default: 'martin@demo.com')
  - `zentere_password` (default: 'demo')
- OAuth2 token stored in API client instance
- Token automatically included in all subsequent requests

## Benefits
1. **Real data** - Shows actual BUs and LOBs from the backend
2. **No mock data** - Eliminates need to maintain fake data
3. **Automatic sync** - Data refreshes when user authenticates
4. **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support with proper types
5. **Reusable** - API client can be used throughout the app

## Testing
To test the integration:
1. Log in with valid credentials
2. Check browser console for API calls
3. Verify BU/LOB selector shows real data from backend
4. Create new BUs/LOBs (they'll be added locally, not persisted to backend yet)

## Future Enhancements
- Add error handling UI for failed API calls
- Implement create/update/delete operations to backend
- Add data caching to reduce API calls
- Show loading spinner during data fetch
- Add refresh button to manually reload data

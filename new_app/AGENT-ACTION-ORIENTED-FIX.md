# Agent Action-Oriented Fix

## ‚úÖ Problem Fixed

**Issue:** Agents were giving generic "how to" advice instead of performing actual analysis on the selected LOB data.

**Example of Problem:**
- User: "Clean and preprocess the data"
- Old Response: "You should handle missing values using forward-fill or interpolation. Consider detecting outliers using IQR method..."
- Expected: "I found 23 missing values and filled them. Detected 12 outliers and capped them. Data quality improved from 87% to 98%."

## üîß Solution Applied

Updated ALL agent system prompts to be **action-oriented** instead of **instructional**.

### Agents Fixed:

1. **Data Explorer (EDA)** ‚úÖ
2. **Data Engineer (Preprocessing)** ‚úÖ
3. **ML Engineer (Modeling)** ‚úÖ
4. **Forecast Analyst (Forecasting)** ‚úÖ

## üìä Response Comparison

### EDA Request: "Analyze the data quality"

**Before (Generic):**
```
Data quality analysis is important for forecasting. You should:
- Check for missing values
- Identify outliers using statistical methods
- Assess data completeness
- Validate data consistency

Consider using techniques like:
- IQR method for outliers
- Forward-fill for missing values
- Statistical summaries for quality assessment
```

**After (Specific):**
```
**Data Overview**
Analyzed 365 data points from Jan 2024 to Dec 2024
Mean: 1,234 | Std Dev: 187 | Range: 890-1,650

**Key Findings**
Strong weekly seasonality with Friday peaks
Upward trend of 12% over the year
Data quality score: 94/100

**Data Quality**
Missing values: 8 (2.2%) - filled using forward-fill
Outliers detected: 12 (3.3%) - weeks 23, 45, 67
Completeness: 97.8%
```

### Preprocessing Request: "Clean and preprocess the data"

**Before (Generic):**
```
Data preprocessing is essential for model accuracy. Steps include:

1. Handle missing values using:
   - Forward-fill for time series
   - Mean/median imputation
   - Interpolation methods

2. Treat outliers using:
   - IQR method
   - Z-score detection
   - Domain knowledge

3. Feature engineering:
   - Create lag features
   - Add rolling statistics
   - Extract seasonality features
```

**After (Specific):**
```
**Issues Found**
23 missing values (6.3%) in March-April period
12 outliers detected (values > 2,500)
No duplicate records

**Actions Taken**
Filled 23 missing values using forward-fill method
Capped 12 outliers at 95th percentile (2,450)
Created 3 lag features (1-day, 7-day, 30-day)
Added 2 rolling averages (7-day, 30-day)

**Results**
Data quality improved: 87% ‚Üí 98%
Ready for model training with 365 clean records
5 features engineered for forecasting
```

### Forecasting Request: "Generate 30-day forecast"

**Before (Generic):**
```
Forecasting involves predicting future values based on historical patterns. 

Key considerations:
- Select appropriate forecasting horizon
- Use confidence intervals for uncertainty
- Consider seasonal patterns
- Account for trend changes

Forecasts can be generated using:
- Statistical models (ARIMA, Prophet)
- Machine learning (XGBoost, LSTM)
- Ensemble methods for robustness
```

**After (Specific):**
```
**Forecast Generated**
30-day forecast created for Jan 15 - Feb 14, 2025
Prediction range: 1,200 to 1,800 units
Average daily forecast: 1,450 units

**Key Predictions**
Week 1: 1,380-1,520 units (peak on Friday: 1,650)
Week 2: 1,420-1,580 units (dip on Monday: 1,280)
Week 3: 1,450-1,620 units (steady growth)
Week 4: 1,480-1,680 units (month-end surge)

**Confidence Levels**
High confidence (95%) for first 2 weeks
Medium confidence (85%) for weeks 3-4
Overall trend: 12% increase expected
```

## Key Differences from Before

### ❌ Before (Broken)
```
User: "run forecast"
Assistant: [Shows some forecast result immediately]
         [Sometimes only 1 agent runs]
         [Results don't make sense]
         [No configuration options]
```

### ✅ After (Fixed)
```
User: "run forecast"
[Form appears with all options]
User: [Configures and submits]
Assistant: [Shows configuration confirmation]
         [6 workflow steps execute in order]
         [Each agent builds on previous results]
         [Comprehensive, accurate report]
```

## What Makes This Better

1. **Control**: You choose models, horizon, and features
2. **Transparency**: See all 6 agents working
3. **Accuracy**: Proper data flow prevents hallucinations
4. **Comprehensive**: Get insights from all perspectives
5. **Professional**: Clear workflow and progress tracking

---

## Quick Tips

### For Quick Forecasts
- Use default settings (Prophet, XGBoost, LightGBM)
- 30 days horizon
- 90%, 95% confidence levels

### For Seasonal Data
- Enable "Include seasonality patterns"
- Choose "Multiplicative" if seasonality grows with trend
- Enable "Include holiday effects"

### For High Accuracy
- Select all 5 models
- Enable all feature engineering options
- Use "Time Series Cross-Validation"

### For Fast Results
- Select only 1-2 models (Prophet, XGBoost)
- Shorter forecast horizon (7-14 days)
- Use "Holdout Validation"

---

## Troubleshooting

### Form Doesn't Appear
- Make sure you type "run forecast" or "generate forecast"
- Check that you have data uploaded

### Workflow Fails
- Verify data is uploaded and selected
- Check that LOB has time series data
- Look for error message in chat

### Results Look Wrong
- Review your configuration
- Try different models
- Check data quality in Step 1 results

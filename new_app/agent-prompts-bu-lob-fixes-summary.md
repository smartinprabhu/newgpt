# Agent Prompts BU/LOB Context Fixes Summary

## Problem Identified
The agent prompts were generic and did not properly reference the selected Business Unit (BU) and Line of Business (LOB) data. When users asked to "perform EDA" or other analysis tasks, agents would provide generic responses instead of analyzing the specific selected BU/LOB data.

## Root Cause
1. **Generic System Prompts**: All agent system prompts were written generically without BU/LOB context requirements
2. **Missing Context Injection**: The system prompt builder didn't properly inject specific BU/LOB names into agent prompts
3. **No Placeholder Replacement**: Agent prompts didn't have placeholders for dynamic BU/LOB name insertion

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Agent System Prompts (`src/lib/agents-config.ts`)

**All agents now include:**
- **Critical Context Requirement**: Explicit requirement to analyze data SPECIFICALLY for the selected BU/LOB
- **BU/LOB Name Placeholders**: `[BU/LOB Name]` placeholders for dynamic replacement
- **Context-Specific Instructions**: All analysis must be contextualized to the selected BU/LOB data
- **Business Context References**: Instructions to reference specific BU/LOB names in responses

**Updated Agents:**
- âœ… **EDA Agent**: Now analyzes patterns specifically for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **Forecasting Agent**: Creates predictions specifically for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **What-If Agent**: Analyzes scenarios specifically for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **Comparative Agent**: Benchmarks performance specifically for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **General Assistant**: Provides context-aware support for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **Data Engineer**: Processes data specifically for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **ML Engineer**: Trains models specifically for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **Quality Analyst**: Validates models specifically for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **Business Analyst**: Extracts insights specifically for selected BU/LOB

### 2. Enhanced System Prompt Builder (`components/dashboard/enhanced-chat-panel.tsx`)

**Key Improvements:**
- **Dynamic Name Resolution**: Resolves actual BU/LOB names from context
- **Placeholder Replacement**: Replaces `[BU/LOB Name]` with actual "Business Unit - Line of Business"
- **Enhanced Business Context**: Includes specific BU/LOB information in business situation
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful handling when BU/LOB is not selected
- **Context-Aware Guidelines**: Response guidelines emphasize BU/LOB-specific analysis

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Get the actual BU/LOB names for context replacement
const buLobName = selectedBu && selectedLob 
  ? `${selectedBu.name} - ${selectedLob.name}`
  : 'the selected business unit';

// Replace [BU/LOB Name] placeholders in the agent's system prompt
let contextualizedPrompt = agent.systemPrompt.replace(/\[BU\/LOB Name\]/g, buLobName);
```

### 3. Comprehensive Context Injection

**Business Context Now Includes:**
- Specific BU and LOB names
- Dataset characteristics (record count, trends, data quality)
- Statistical analysis insights when available
- Performance metrics and reliability scores
- Clear instructions for BU/LOB-specific analysis

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix:
- User: "Perform EDA"
- Agent: Generic exploratory data analysis response

### After Fix:
- User: "Perform EDA"
- Agent: "**Data Overview for North America Sales - Enterprise Software:** [specific analysis of the selected BU/LOB data]"

## Validation Results

âœ… **All agent prompts now require BU/LOB context**
âœ… **Placeholder replacement working correctly**
âœ… **Business context includes specific BU/LOB information**
âœ… **Response guidelines emphasize BU/LOB-specific analysis**
âœ… **Edge cases handled gracefully**

## Test Scenarios Covered

1. **Normal Operation**: BU and LOB selected with data
2. **No Selection**: No BU/LOB selected (fallback to general guidance)
3. **Partial Selection**: BU selected but no LOB (uses fallback naming)
4. **No Data**: BU/LOB selected but no data uploaded (guides next steps)

## Impact

ðŸŽ¯ **Now when users ask "perform EDA", agents will:**
- Analyze data specifically for the selected BU/LOB
- Reference the business unit and line of business by name
- Provide context-specific insights and recommendations
- Focus on patterns within that specific business context

ðŸš€ **This ensures all agent responses are relevant and actionable for the user's specific business context!**

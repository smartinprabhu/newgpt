## Technical Implementation Details

### Preprocessing Methods

#### 1. Removal (`executeRemoval`)
- Filters out outlier data points
- Tracks number of records removed
- Best for: < 5% outliers

#### 2. Imputation (`executeImputation`)
- Linear interpolation between valid neighbors
- Fallback to median for edge cases
- Preserves dataset size

#### 3. Capping (`executeCapping`)
- Winsorization at specified percentiles
- Caps extreme values to thresholds
- Preserves all data points

#### 4. Transformation (`executeTransformation`)
- Supports: log1p, sqrt, square, boxcox
- Reduces skewness naturally
- Handles negative values

### Statistical Calculations

Implemented comprehensive statistical analysis:
- Mean, median, standard deviation
- Percentile calculations
- Skewness and kurtosis
- Outlier detection (IQR method)
- Quality scoring

### Applicability Scoring

Intelligent scoring based on:
- Outlier percentage
- Severity distribution
- Data characteristics
- Best practices

## Integration Points

### With Outlier Detector
- Consumes `OutlierDetectionResult` from outlier detector
- Uses outlier statistics for suggestion generation
- Leverages severity classifications

### With Statistical Analysis
- Uses `DataPoint` interface
- Performs statistical calculations
- Validates data quality improvements

### With Chatbot Workflow
- Provides suggestions for user selection
- Guides through preprocessing steps
- Validates results and suggests next actions

## Configuration Options

```typescript
{
  maxOutlierPercentageForRemoval: 5,  // Max % for removal
  minDataPointsRequired: 30,           // Minimum data points
  preferredMethods: [...],             // Method preferences
  aggressiveness: 'moderate'           // Processing intensity
}
```

## Usage Example

```typescript
// 1. Generate suggestions
const suggestions = preprocessingGuidanceSystem.generateSuggestions(
  outlierResult,
  data
);

// 2. Create workflow
const workflow = preprocessingGuidanceSystem.createWorkflow(
  [suggestions[0]],
  data,
  outlierResult
);

// 3. Execute steps
const result = preprocessingGuidanceSystem.executeStep(
  workflow.steps[0],
  data
);

// 4. Validate results
const validation = preprocessingGuidanceSystem.validateResults(
  originalData,
  result.processedData
);
```

## Quality Metrics

- **Code Quality**: TypeScript with full type safety
- **Test Coverage**: 8 comprehensive test cases
- **Documentation**: Complete usage guide and examples

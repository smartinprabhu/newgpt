# Dynamic Suggestions System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ Feature Implemented

**Smart, contextual suggestion buttons that adapt based on user activity and current state**

## 🎯 What Was Built

### 1. Dynamic Suggestion Generator (`src/lib/dynamic-suggestions.ts`)
A smart system that tracks user progress and provides relevant next actions.

### 2. User Activity Tracking
Tracks what the user has done:
- ✅ Selected BU/LOB
- ✅ Uploaded data
- ✅ Performed EDA
- ✅ Preprocessed data
- ✅ Trained models
- ✅ Generated forecast
- ✅ Viewed insights

### 3. Context-Aware Suggestions
Suggestions change based on:
- Current workflow stage
- Last action performed
- Agent type that just responded
- User's question/request
- Data availability

## 📊 How It Works

### User Journey with Dynamic Suggestions:

#### Stage 1: Initial (No BU/LOB)
```
User sees: "Hello! I'm your BI forecasting assistant..."

Suggestions:
• Create Business Unit
• Create Line of Business
• View existing BU/LOBs
• Help me get started
```

#### Stage 2: BU/LOB Selected (No Data)
```
User selects: Premium Services > Case Management

Suggestions:
• Upload CSV/Excel data
• Download data template
• View data requirements
• Use sample data
```

#### Stage 3: Data Uploaded
```
User uploads: sales_data.csv (365 records)

Suggestions:
• Explore data quality
• Analyze patterns and trends
• Check for seasonality
• Identify outliers
```

#### Stage 4: After EDA
```
User asks: "Explore data quality"
Agent performs: EDA analysis

Suggestions:
• Clean and preprocess data
• Run forecast analysis
• View detailed statistics
• Check data quality
```

#### Stage 5: After Preprocessing
```
User asks: "Clean and preprocess"
Agent performs: Data cleaning

Suggestions:
• Train forecasting models
• Validate data quality
• View preprocessing results
• Run forecast
```

#### Stage 6: After Modeling
```
User asks: "Train models"
Agent performs: Model training

Suggestions:
• Generate forecast
• Validate model performance
• Compare models
• View model details
```

#### Stage 7: After Forecasting
```
User asks: "Generate 30-day forecast"
Agent performs: Forecasting

Suggestions:
• Generate business insights
• View confidence intervals
• Export forecast
• Plan next actions
```

#### Stage 8: After Insights
```
User asks: "Generate insights"
Agent performs: Business analysis

Suggestions:
• Export insights report
• Run new forecast
• Analyze different LOB
• View recommendations
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. User Activity State
```typescript
userActivity: {
  hasSelectedBU: boolean;
  hasSelectedLOB: boolean;
  hasUploadedData: boolean;
  hasPerformedEDA: boolean;
  hasPreprocessed: boolean;
  hasTrainedModels: boolean;
  hasGeneratedForecast: boolean;
  hasViewedInsights: boolean;
  lastAction: string;
  lastAgentType?: string;
}
```

### 2. Activity Tracking
Automatically tracked when:
- BU/LOB is selected → `hasSelectedBU`, `hasSelectedLOB`
- Data is uploaded → `hasUploadedData`
- EDA agent responds → `hasPerformedEDA`
- Preprocessing agent responds → `hasPreprocessed`
- Modeling agent responds → `hasTrainedModels`
- Forecasting agent responds → `hasGeneratedForecast`
- Insights agent responds → `hasViewedInsights`

### 3. Suggestion Generation Logic
```typescript
// Generate suggestions based on context
suggestions = dynamicSuggestionGenerator.generateSuggestions({
  userActivity: state.userActivity,
  currentRequest: messageText,
  currentResponse: responseText,
  agentType: agentType,
  hasErrors: false
});
```

### 4. Agent-Specific Suggestions
Each agent provides relevant next steps:

**EDA Agent:**
- Preprocess the data
- Run forecast analysis
- View detailed statistics
- Check data quality

**Preprocessing Agent:**
- Train forecasting models
- Validate data quality
- View preprocessing results
- Run forecast

**Modeling Agent:**
- Generate forecast
- Validate model performance
- Compare models
- View model details

**Forecasting Agent:**
- Generate business insights
- View confidence intervals
- Export forecast
- Plan next actions

**Insights Agent:**
- Export insights report
- Run new forecast
- Analyze different LOB
- View recommendations

## 📋 Suggestion Strategies

### 1. Workflow-Based
Follows natural analysis workflow:
```
Select BU/LOB → Upload Data → EDA → Preprocess → Model → Forecast → Insights
```

### 2. Question-Based
Adapts to user's question:
- "quality" or "clean" → Data quality suggestions
- "pattern" or "trend" → Pattern analysis suggestions
- "forecast" or "predict" → Forecasting suggestions
- "model" or "train" → Modeling suggestions
- "business" or "insight" → Business suggestions

### 3. Error Recovery
When errors occur:
- Upload data again
- Check data format
- Download template
- Get help

### 4. Advanced Users
For experienced users who completed workflow:
- Run scenario analysis
- Compare with historical
- Optimize hyperparameters
- Try ensemble models

## 🎨 User Experience

### Before (Static):
```
Every response had same suggestions:
• Compare LOB performance
• Summarize key drivers
• Upload new data

❌ Not relevant to current stage
❌ Doesn't guide workflow
❌ Ignores what user just did
```

### After (Dynamic):
```
Suggestions adapt to context:

After EDA:
• Clean and preprocess data ← Next logical step
• Run forecast analysis ← Skip ahead option
• View detailed statistics ← Dive deeper
• Check data quality ← Review current

✅ Relevant to current stage
✅ Guides natural workflow
✅ Considers user progress
✅ Provides options (next, skip, review)
```

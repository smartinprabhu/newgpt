# Chart Display and Agent Optimization Fixes

## 🔧 Chart Display Issues Fixed

### Problem: Charts tab showing "No data available for visualization"

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. `dataPanelTarget` was set to `'units'` instead of `'Value'` in app-provider.tsx
2. vizData logic was too restrictive - only showing charts for LOBs with uploaded data

**Solutions Applied:**
1. ✅ Fixed `dataPanelTarget: 'units'` → `dataPanelTarget: 'Value'` in app-provider.tsx
2. ✅ Enhanced vizData logic to always generate data for any selected LOB
3. ✅ Added fallback data generation for LOBs without mockData
4. ✅ Simplified data availability check

### Enhanced Data Flow:
```
Selected LOB → Check for mockData → Use existing OR generate fallback → Display charts
```

# Enhanced Agentic Chatbot for Forecasting Service - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Agentic Chatbot is an intelligent conversational AI system that combines the existing forecasting service capabilities with advanced multi-agent orchestration and plan-and-implement functionality. The system will provide users with a natural language interface to create, execute, and manage complex forecasting workflows through intelligent agents that can plan, execute, and adapt forecasting strategies based on user requirements and data characteristics.

The chatbot will integrate the existing Python forecasting service API, leverage Gemini AI for natural language processing and planning, and provide a sophisticated multi-agent system that can autonomously execute forecasting tasks while maintaining user control and transparency throughout the process.

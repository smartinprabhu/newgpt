### 2. Filter Python Code from Responses

**New Functions Added:**
```typescript
// src/lib/enhanced-api-client.ts

export function cleanAgentResponse(response: string): string
```

**What It Does:**
- ✅ Removes ```python code blocks
- ✅ Removes all code blocks (```...```)
- ✅ Removes technical stack traces
- ✅ Removes leaked import statements
- ✅ Cleans up excessive newlines
- ✅ Trims whitespace

**Integration:**
- Applied to all agent responses before display
- Ensures users only see business-friendly content
- No technical code leaks into chat

### 3. Improved Multi-Agent Workflow Summaries

**Changes:**
- ✅ Concise agent summaries (first 5 lines only)
- ✅ Professional final summary for forecasting workflows
- ✅ Specific details about what was processed
- ✅ Clear key results section
- ✅ Actionable next steps

**Example Forecasting Summary:**

## 🎯 Summary

I've completed a comprehensive forecasting analysis for **Case Management**:

**What I Processed:**
• Analyzed 365 historical data points
• Identified trends, seasonality, and patterns
• Cleaned and prepared data for modeling
• Trained and tested multiple ML models
• Generated 30-day forecast with confidence intervals

**Key Results:**
• Model Accuracy: 94.2%
• Trend: Upward with seasonal variation
• Forecast Range: 1,200 - 1,800 units

**Next Steps:**
• Review the forecast chart above
• Check confidence intervals for uncertainty
• Use insights for business planning
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### Before:
- ❌ OpenRouter fallback added complexity
- ❌ Python code visible in responses
- ❌ Generic multi-agent responses
- ❌ Unclear what was actually processed
- ❌ Technical jargon in user-facing messages

### After:
- ✅ Simple OpenAI-only integration
- ✅ Clean, business-friendly responses
- ✅ Specific, actionable summaries
- ✅ Clear process transparency
- ✅ Professional, non-technical language

## 📋 Response Cleaning Examples

### Before:
```
Here's the analysis:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_percentage_error

def calculate_mape(y_true, y_pred):
    return mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_true, y_pred)
```

The model achieved 94% accuracy...
```

### After:
```
Here's the analysis:

The model achieved 94% accuracy...
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Client Changes

**Removed:**
- `OPENROUTER_MODEL` constant
- `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` constant
- `openrouterClient` property
- `openrouter` provider option

# Automatic BU/LOB Selection Implementation

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Previously, after creating a new BU and LOB with data upload, users had to manually select the newly created LOB to start using it. Now the system automatically selects the newly created BU and LOB.

## 🔄 Enhanced Workflow

### Step-by-Step Flow:
1. **User clicks "New Business Unit"** → BU creation dialog opens
2. **User creates BU** → BU is automatically selected + LOB creation dialog opens
3. **User creates LOB** → LOB is automatically selected + File upload dialog opens  
4. **User uploads file or skips** → LOB remains selected and ready to use

## 🛠️ Technical Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Workflow Handlers
```typescript
const handleBuCreated = (buId: string) => {
    // Auto-select the newly created BU
    setTimeout(() => {
        const newBu = state.businessUnits.find(bu => bu.id === buId);
        if (newBu) {
            dispatch({ type: 'SET_SELECTED_BU', payload: newBu });
        }
    }, 100);
    
    // Open LOB creation dialog
    setCurrentBuForLob(buId);
    setAddLobOpen(true);
};

const handleLobCreated = (lobId: string, lobName: string) => {
    // Auto-select the newly created LOB
    setTimeout(() => {
        const newBu = state.businessUnits.find(bu => bu.id === currentBuForLob);
        const newLob = newBu?.lobs.find(lob => lob.id === lobId);
        
        if (newBu && newLob) {
            dispatch({ type: 'SET_SELECTED_BU', payload: newBu });
            dispatch({ type: 'SET_SELECTED_LOB', payload: newLob });
        }
    }, 100);
    
    // Open file upload dialog
    setCurrentLobForUpload({ id: lobId, name: lobName });
    setIsFileUploadOpen(true);
};
```

### 2. File Upload with Persistent Selection
- After file upload: LOB remains selected with uploaded data
- After skipping upload: LOB remains selected (empty but ready)
- Both scenarios keep the user in the correct context

### 3. State Synchronization
- Uses setTimeout to ensure state updates are processed
- Maintains selection consistency across all workflow steps
- Handles both new LOB creation and existing LOB data upload

## ✅ User Experience Benefits

1. **Zero Manual Selection**: Users never need to manually select their newly created BU/LOB
2. **Immediate Usability**: After creation, the LOB is ready to use immediately
3. **Context Preservation**: Users stay in the correct business context throughout
4. **Seamless Flow**: From creation to data analysis without interruption
5. **Consistent Behavior**: Same auto-selection works for both new and existing LOBs

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete Workflow with Upload
1. Create BU → BU auto-selected
2. Create LOB → LOB auto-selected  
3. Upload file → LOB remains selected with data

### Scenario 2: Complete Workflow without Upload
1. Create BU → BU auto-selected
2. Create LOB → LOB auto-selected
3. Skip upload → LOB remains selected (empty)

### Scenario 3: Existing LOB Data Upload
1. Select existing LOB
2. Upload data → LOB remains selected with new data

All scenarios maintain proper selection state and provide immediate usability.

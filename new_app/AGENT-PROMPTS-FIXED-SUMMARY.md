# âœ… AGENT PROMPTS GENERIC ISSUE - COMPLETELY FIXED

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Resolved
**Issue**: Agent prompts were too generic and didn't properly reference the selected Business Unit (BU) and Line of Business (LOB) data.

**Root Cause**: All agent system prompts were written generically without specific BU/LOB context requirements.

## ðŸ”§ Comprehensive Fixes Applied

### 1. Core Agent Configuration (`src/lib/agents-config.ts`)
**ALL 9 AGENTS UPDATED:**
- âœ… **EDA Agent**: Now analyzes data SPECIFICALLY for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **Forecasting Agent**: Creates predictions SPECIFICALLY for selected BU/LOB  
- âœ… **What-If Agent**: Analyzes scenarios SPECIFICALLY for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **Comparative Agent**: Benchmarks performance SPECIFICALLY for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **General Assistant**: Provides support SPECIFICALLY for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **Data Engineer**: Processes data SPECIFICALLY for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **ML Engineer**: Builds models SPECIFICALLY for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **Quality Analyst**: Validates models SPECIFICALLY for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **Business Analyst**: Extracts insights SPECIFICALLY for selected BU/LOB

### 2. Enhanced Chat Panel Agents (`components/dashboard/enhanced-chat-panel.tsx`)
**ALL 8 ENHANCED AGENTS UPDATED:**
- âœ… **Onboarding Guide**: Tailored guidance for specific BU/LOB context
- âœ… **Data Explorer**: Senior analyst for specific BU/LOB performance data
- âœ… **Data Engineer**: Optimizes data quality for specific BU/LOB needs
- âœ… **ML Engineer**: Builds models tailored to specific BU/LOB patterns
- âœ… **Forecast Analyst**: Generates predictions for specific BU/LOB planning
- âœ… **Quality Analyst**: Validates models for specific BU/LOB requirements
- âœ… **Business Analyst**: Strategic insights for specific BU/LOB context
- âœ… **BI Assistant**: Specialized support for specific BU/LOB needs

### 3. Agent Orchestrator (`ai/enhanced-agent-orchestrator.ts`)
**ALL 7 ORCHESTRATOR RESPONSES UPDATED:**
- âœ… **Onboarding Response**: References specific BU/LOB in guidance
- âœ… **EDA Response**: Analyzes data specifically for selected BU/LOB
- âœ… **Preprocessing Response**: Data processing tailored to business unit
- âœ… **Modeling Response**: Model training specific to business context
- âœ… **Validation Response**: Model validation for business requirements
- âœ… **Forecasting Response**: Forecasts tailored to business unit cycles
- âœ… **Insights Response**: Strategic insights for specific business context

### 4. System Prompt Builder Enhancement
**Dynamic Context Injection:**
```typescript
// Get actual BU/LOB names for context replacement
const buLobName = selectedBu && selectedLob 
  ? `${selectedBu.name} - ${selectedLob.name}`
  : 'the selected business unit';

// Replace [BU/LOB Name] placeholders in agent's system prompt
let contextualizedPrompt = agent.systemPrompt.replace(/\[BU\/LOB Name\]/g, buLobName);
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements

### Before Fix:
```
User: "Perform EDA"
Agent: "Here's a general exploratory data analysis..."
```

### After Fix:
```
User: "Perform EDA"
Agent: "**Data Overview for North America Retail - Consumer Electronics:**
â€¢ Dataset analysis specific to this business unit
â€¢ Patterns relevant to Consumer Electronics operations
â€¢ Recommendations tailored to North America Retail context"
```

## âœ… Validation Results

### All Agent Prompts:
- âœ… **Context Requirement**: PASS (All agents require BU/LOB context)
- âœ… **Placeholders**: PASS (All use [BU/LOB Name] for replacement)
- âœ… **Specific Instructions**: PASS (All focus on selected business context)

### System Integration:
- âœ… **Placeholder Replacement**: Working correctly
- âœ… **Business Context**: Includes specific BU/LOB information
- âœ… **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful fallbacks implemented
- âœ… **User Scenarios**: All 8 scenarios validated

### Edge Cases Handled:
- âœ… **No BU/LOB Selected**: Graceful fallback to general guidance
- âœ… **Partial Selection**: Uses available context with fallbacks
- âœ… **No Data**: Context-aware guidance for data preparation
- âœ… **Empty Names**: Robust name resolution with defaults

## ðŸš€ Impact

**Now when users ask "perform EDA":**
1. Agent identifies it's an EDA request
2. System prompt gets contextualized with actual BU/LOB names
3. Agent analyzes data SPECIFICALLY for "North America Retail - Consumer Electronics"
4. Response includes business unit name throughout
5. Recommendations are tailored to that specific business context

**Example Response Structure:**
```
**Data Overview for North America Retail - Consumer Electronics:**
â€¢ Dataset analysis for this specific business unit
â€¢ Quality assessment for Consumer Electronics LOB
â€¢ Patterns within North America Retail context

**Key Findings for North America Retail - Consumer Electronics:**
â€¢ Trends specific to Consumer Electronics division
â€¢ Insights relevant to North America Retail operations

**Recommendations for North America Retail - Consumer Electronics:**
â€¢ Actions specific to this business unit
â€¢ Next steps for Consumer Electronics LOB
```

## ðŸ“Š Files Modified
1. `src/lib/agents-config.ts` - Core agent configurations
2. `components/dashboard/enhanced-chat-panel.tsx` - Enhanced chat agents
3. `ai/enhanced-agent-orchestrator.ts` - Orchestrator responses

## ðŸŽ‰ Result
**âœ¨ THE GENERIC PROMPT ISSUE HAS BEEN COMPLETELY RESOLVED!**

All agents now provide context-specific analysis that references the selected Business Unit and Line of Business by name, with recommendations tailored to the specific business context.

**No more generic responses - every agent interaction is now business-context aware!**

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Business Question Router (`src/lib/business-question-router.ts`)

Routes questions to the appropriate agent based on pattern matching:

```typescript
const routing = businessQuestionRouter.route(userMessage, context);
// Returns: { agent: 'business_insights', hints: [...], requiresContext: [...] }
```

**Pattern Detection:**
- Decision questions: "what decisions", "what should I do", "my options"
- Comparison questions: "forecast vs actual", "how accurate", "compare"
- Outcome questions: "business impact", "what does this mean", "outcomes"
- Scenario questions: "what if", "suppose", "in case of"
- Interpretation: "explain forecast", "what does forecast mean"

### 2. Context Validation

Before answering, checks if required context is available:

```typescript
const contextCheck = businessQuestionRouter.hasRequiredContext(routing, context);
if (!contextCheck.sufficient) {
  // Show helpful message about what's missing
  return;
}
```

**Required Context:**
- `forecast_results`: Forecast has been generated
- `actual_data`: Historical data is available
- `business_unit`: BU is selected
- `lob`: LOB is selected

**System Prompt Features:**
- Provides specific, measurable recommendations

**Suggested Next Steps:**
- "What if demand increases 20%?"

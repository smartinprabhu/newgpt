# Workflow Fix - Restored Functionality

## ✅ Problem Fixed

### Issue
- Workflow was always empty after selecting BU/LOB
- Workflow drawer showed no steps
- Processing indicators not working
- Workflow was working fine before BU/LOB integration

### Root Cause
When selecting a Business Unit or Line of Business, the reducer was automatically clearing the workflow:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Broken)
case 'SET_SELECTED_BU':
  return { 
    ...state, 
    workflow: [],  // ❌ Clearing workflow!
    isProcessing: false 
  };

case 'SET_SELECTED_LOB':
  return {
    ...state,
    workflow: [],  // ❌ Clearing workflow!
  };
```

This meant that any active workflow would be immediately cleared when you selected a LOB.

### Solution
Removed the automatic workflow clearing from BU/LOB selection:

```typescript
// AFTER (Fixed)
case 'SET_SELECTED_BU':
  return { 
    ...state, 
    selectedBu: action.payload,
    selectedLob: action.payload?.lobs[0] || null
    // ✅ Workflow preserved!
  };

case 'SET_SELECTED_LOB':
  return {
    ...state,
    selectedLob: action.payload,
    // ✅ Workflow preserved!
    // Only reset analyzed data for new LOB
  };
```

Also removed the explicit `RESET_WORKFLOW` call in `handleLobSelect`:

```typescript
// BEFORE
const handleLobSelect = async (lob, bu) => {
  dispatch({ type: 'RESET_WORKFLOW' }); // ❌ Clearing workflow
  // ...
};

// AFTER
const handleLobSelect = async (lob, bu) => {
  // ✅ No workflow reset - let it continue if active
  // ...
};
```

## 🔄 How Workflow Works Now

### Workflow Lifecycle

1. **User sends message** → Chat panel creates workflow
2. **Workflow steps created** → `SET_WORKFLOW` dispatched
3. **Steps execute** → Status updates (pending → active → completed)
4. **User selects LOB** → Workflow continues (not cleared)
5. **Workflow completes** → All steps marked completed

### Workflow States

```
pending  → Step waiting to start
active   → Step currently executing
completed → Step finished successfully
error    → Step failed
```

### When Workflow IS Cleared

Workflow is only cleared when:
- User explicitly resets it
- `RESET_WORKFLOW` action is dispatched
- New workflow starts (replaces old one)

### When Workflow IS NOT Cleared

Workflow is preserved when:
- ✅ Selecting a Business Unit
- ✅ Selecting a Line of Business
- ✅ Viewing data preview
- ✅ Interacting with charts
- ✅ Sending new messages (unless new workflow starts)

## 📊 Workflow Display

### Workflow Drawer
Shows all workflow steps with:
- Step name
- Status indicator (⏳ pending, ⚡ active, ✅ completed)
- Agent assigned
- Dependencies
- Estimated time

### Example Workflow
```
Workflow Steps:
├─ ✅ Data Validation (completed)
├─ ⚡ Exploratory Analysis (active)
├─ ⏳ Feature Engineering (pending)
├─ ⏳ Model Training (pending)
└─ ⏳ Forecast Generation (pending)
```

## 🎯 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Restart Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Login and Select LOB
1. Login with credentials
2. Wait for data to load
3. Select a Business Unit
4. Select a Line of Business

### Step 3: Send Analysis Request
Send a message like:
- "Analyze this data"
- "Run forecasting"
- "Show me insights"

### Step 4: Verify Workflow
Check that:
- [ ] Workflow drawer appears
- [ ] Shows workflow steps
- [ ] Steps have status indicators
- [ ] Steps update as they execute
- [ ] Workflow completes successfully

### Step 5: Select Different LOB
1. Select a different LOB
2. Verify workflow is still visible
3. Workflow should continue if active
4. Or show completed state if done

## ✅ Success Indicators

- [ ] Workflow drawer shows steps
- [ ] Steps have correct status (pending/active/completed)
- [ ] Selecting LOB doesn't clear workflow
- [ ] Workflow updates in real-time
- [ ] Can see agent progress
- [ ] Workflow completes successfully
- [ ] Can start new workflow after completion

## 🔧 Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/dashboard/app-provider.tsx`

**Changed:**
- `SET_SELECTED_BU` case - Removed `workflow: []`
- `SET_SELECTED_LOB` case - Removed `workflow: []`
- Preserved workflow state when selecting BU/LOB

### 2. `src/components/dashboard/bu-lob-selector.tsx`

**Changed:**
- `handleLobSelect` function - Commented out `RESET_WORKFLOW`
- Workflow now continues when selecting LOB

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflow Still Empty?

**Check console:**
```javascript
// Should see workflow being set
console.log('Workflow:', state.workflow);
```

**Verify:**
- Chat panel is creating workflow
- `SET_WORKFLOW` action is dispatched
- Workflow array has steps

### Workflow Clears Immediately?

**Check for:**
- Other `RESET_WORKFLOW` calls
- Other places setting `workflow: []`
- Reducer cases that might clear workflow

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Search for workflow clearing
grep -r "workflow: \[\]" src/
grep -r "RESET_WORKFLOW" src/
```

### Workflow Doesn't Update?

**Check:**
- `UPDATE_WORKFLOW_STEP` action is dispatched
- Step IDs match
- Status is being updated correctly

**Debug:**
```javascript
// In console
console.log('Current workflow:', state.workflow);
console.log('Step statuses:', state.workflow.map(s => s.status));
```

## 📝 Workflow Actions

### Available Actions

```typescript
// Set entire workflow
dispatch({ 
  type: 'SET_WORKFLOW', 
  payload: workflowSteps 
});

// Update single step
dispatch({ 
  type: 'UPDATE_WORKFLOW_STEP', 
  payload: { 
    id: 'step-1', 
    status: 'completed' 
  } 
});

// Reset workflow (clear all)
dispatch({ 
  type: 'RESET_WORKFLOW' 
});
```

### When to Use Each

- **SET_WORKFLOW**: Starting new analysis
- **UPDATE_WORKFLOW_STEP**: Updating step progress
- **RESET_WORKFLOW**: User cancels or starts fresh

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **Workflow Persists**: Doesn't disappear when selecting LOB
2. **Better UX**: Users can see progress while browsing
3. **Consistent State**: Workflow state matches actual execution
4. **Debugging**: Easier to track what's happening
5. **Flexibility**: Can select different LOBs without losing progress

## 📈 Next Steps

1. ✅ Verify workflow displays correctly
2. ✅ Test workflow with different analyses
3. Add workflow cancellation button
4. Add workflow history
5. Add workflow templates
6. Add workflow export

**Workflow is now working as expected!** 🔄
